This repository contains the code for the research I conducted at UC Santa Cruz to aid emergency responders in identifying, locating, and tracking active shooters in a simulated shooting situation.

I developed a machine learning model trained through a support vector machine executing a statistical classification in order to classify shooter from civilian based on movement patterns in the simulation. My primary basis in differentiating shooter from civilian rests on an assumption of human psychological behaviorâ€” civilians will tend to hide near obstructions, run, or attack; as such, shooters will tend to be in constant motion and enter areas of higher civilian density. 

I also aimed to determine areas of high civilian density in order to aid in civilian search and rescue as organized by first responders. To this end, I used the open source data set, StudentLife, procured by Brown University and Northeastern University through their StudentLife study that used wifi servers on campus to track the movements of 48 Brown students over a 10 week period. I mined this data in order to analyze crowding levels of each of 9,038 locations on campus hourly. This information, if readily available, could drastically improve emergency response time to specific locations on campus in the case of an active shooter just as my machine learning model could be utilized by responders to easily identify shooter(s) and monitor them in real time.
